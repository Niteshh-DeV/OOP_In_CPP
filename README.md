# C++ OOP Codes

This repository contains various C++ programs demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. These codes will help you understand key principles of OOP like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and more, using simple and clear examples.

## Basics

In this section, you'll find programs covering the basic syntax and structures of C++, such as:
- Data types
- Variables
- Control structures (if-else, loops)
- Functions
- Arrays and pointers

## Classes and Objects

This section introduces **classes** and **objects**, which are the fundamental building blocks of OOP. Programs demonstrate how to create classes, instantiate objects, and use member functions and data.

## Operator Overloading

Operator overloading allows you to define how operators (e.g., +, -, *, etc.) behave when applied to objects of a class. This section demonstrates how to overload operators for custom behavior.

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a key concept of OOP that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This section explores **single** and **multiple inheritance**.

## Polymorphism and Dynamic Binding

Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their base class while invoking derived class methods at runtime. Dynamic binding enables the correct method to be called based on the object type.

## Templates

Templates enable writing generic code that works with any data type. This section covers **function templates** and **class templates**.

## Exception Handling

Exception handling allows you to manage errors gracefully. This section demonstrates how to use **try**, **catch**, and **throw** to handle runtime exceptions.

## Conclusion

This repository is a growing collection of C++ OOP programs that will help you improve your understanding and proficiency in Object-Oriented Programming concepts. Feel free to contribute, raise issues, or fork the repository for your own use!
